Title : Student Enrollment Form
Description : In this project I have made a student enrollment form where a user enter the details only if the primary key value does NOT exist in the database, if the primary key exists then the details is fetched from JsonPowerDB and the details is shown to the user.
# Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
1) Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
2) Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
3) It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
4) It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
5) It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost
